# Twenkid-Reader-0.1
(Feed) reader &amp; aggregator for Android in Java. 
Developed in a few days (less than a week?) hacking challenge from scratch with no prior mobile-app development experience. Thanks to Ivan for the challenge - to build a sample basic "useful app". That one had a listview with labels and icons, favorites marking, thumbnails, a simple cache for offline viewing, threading, whatever...  Developed with Eclipse.

* The web site parsing code was developed from scratch (not using an API or something) and I don't know if it fits the current layout.
